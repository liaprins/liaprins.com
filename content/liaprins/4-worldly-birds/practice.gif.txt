Caption: 

The first sketch illustrates the number 99 by generating a random number between 1 and 99. Once converted from float to integer, if the random number is less than 99, the background color will remain the same, but if it <em>is</em> the integer 99, the background will change to a randomly generated color. I coded the sketch to run at a frame rate of 99 refreshes per second, so theoretically, the background should change about once per second.

The middle sketch is a timer counting down until the end of finals week at UW. Portraits of my various finals-week-related emotions flash semi-randomly: as the timer fills with “sand” the chances that a panic-stricken portrait will appear increases.

The ladybug sketch explores interactivity: a click on any of the ladybug’s dots changes the pattern of its shell.

Alt: Three sketches I made with Processing. The first shows the number 99 made of flashing colors and colors, featuring a color-changing background. The second has a timer counting down while photos of my face with various emotions change every second. The third has a ladybug illustration and demonstrates the mouse clicking on its dots and in turn changing the pattern on its back.
