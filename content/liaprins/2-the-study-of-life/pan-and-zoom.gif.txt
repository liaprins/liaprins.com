Caption: In addition to its convenience and portability, the iPad-as-microscope holds another advantage over its analog counterpart, in its virtual inability to self-destructively crush a glass slide cover slip beneath a fragile and exorbitantly priced lens â€¦ no need to keep track of the coarse- versus fine-focus knobs anymore! (Please note that this does not preclude the iPad screen itself from breaking if dropped.)
