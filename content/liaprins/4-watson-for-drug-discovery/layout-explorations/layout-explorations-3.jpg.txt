Two more ideas I had both incorporated all three visualizations simultaneously, which mean all three could be compared against each other at once.

But starting with the word spectrum in the initial view meant it would be strangely empty before the user selected any genes to view the evidence of, and it could be a bit overpowering to be greeted by all three data-heavy visualizations simultaneously.

Of the two layouts with all three visualizations shown at once, the one on the left, with the list taking up the full view, would be helpful in that the user could scan more results at once, and without the need to scroll.

The sketch on the right, however, explored the word spectrum at full-width, which would allow it to take the room it needed as a horizontal, <em>spectrum</em>-based visualization.

Alt: Two more screen sketches: one in which the list takes up the left side lengthwise, while the force diagram sits atop the word spectrum, each getting half of the remaining space, and one in which the word spectrum has been stretched to fit the entire bottom section horizontally.
