Caption: Ms. Carassius is a microbiologist researching potential genetic causes for chronic goldfish hiccups. She is already confident of several genes linked to the condition: these she puts into PA’s <em>known entities</em> field. She’s also gathered a long list of potential genes (with the aid of other WDD apps) that she suspects <em>might</em> have a bearing on the disease as well. She lists these in PA’s <em>candidate entities</em> field.
