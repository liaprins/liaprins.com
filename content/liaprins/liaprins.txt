About: 

Welcome to my website! I am a visual and interaction designer hailing from the Pacific Northwest, where I studied and learned to love design at the University of Washington. I eventually moved to Austin to help design better enterprise software experiences...and because I missed sunlight.

I work for IBM, designing analytics software, because I love making complex information understandable and insightful on a visual and tactile level.

I also have a side project in the works that indulges my inquisitive side. It's a website called Curiosity-Colored Glasses, where I'll investigate how and why things in the world around us are the way they are, and explain my findings visually: through images, drawings, and diagrams. I'm in the coding phase right now, but I'll add a link once the site's ready to say hello to the world. :)

Please feel free to get in touch; it would be great to hear from all my fellow designers, explorers, and adventurers out there!
