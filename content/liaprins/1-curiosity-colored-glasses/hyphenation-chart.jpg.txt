Caption: This monstrosity is the self-serving output of a hyphenation-related question. I was, in fact, wondering if my blog title needed a dash to be grammatically correct, and my research sort of spiraled out of control from there. But who hasnâ€™t needed to know when to use a hyphen at one point or another? Others could benefit from my madness, as long as I committed to sharing it in a slightly more refined way.

Alt: What at first seems to be a paper covered in ink scribbles is in fact a decision tree walking through questions and answers to determine whether a hyphen is needed in any given situation.
