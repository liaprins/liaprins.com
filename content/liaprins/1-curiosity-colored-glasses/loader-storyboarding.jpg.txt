Caption: Storyboarding helped me document ideas for a custom loading animation. My initial thought had been to use two typical loading wheels side-by-side, suggesting spectacles. After continuing to iterate, I landed on a more imaginative idea: a pair of glassesâ€™ arms would open, only to be occupied by curious, roving eyes that blinked expectantly.
