Caption: Rather than capping the total compounds permitted to contribute to a gene's total score, another idea was to allow unlimited compounds. I sketched ways to accommodate massive contribution scores, while maintaining a framework that communicated the score's breakdown and whether it had been arrived at via a single highly similar compound or multiple less-similar compounds.
