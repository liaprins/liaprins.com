Caption: In a Pecha Kucha, each slide stays on the screen for exactly 20 seconds. I tried to use the fleeting time wisely, starting with an introduction to the concept of divergent design and idea generation, then transitioning into how the medium of sketching acts as an aid to this part of the process, and ending with tips to help onlookers start sketching more themselves.
