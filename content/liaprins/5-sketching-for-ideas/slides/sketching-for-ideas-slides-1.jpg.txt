Alt: The cover slide for my "Sketching for Ideas" talk features the title, tagline ("pull pen and paper into your process to design more divergently"), and clever—if I do say so myself—sketch of a pencil with its tip connected to a line it looks to have just drawn that extends vertically, swirls elliptically like ripples in a pond, then dips straight down again and ends with a fish hook, surrounded by sideways light bulbs reminiscent of fish.
