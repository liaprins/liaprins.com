Caption: I've learned the hard way to always take advantage of my nightstand Post-it notepadâ€”too many of my ideas have been lost to the night when I'd somehow believed I would still remember them in the morning. For the same reason I always bring a few sticky notes and a pencil with me on my lunchtime walks.

Alt: Six Post-it notes site side-by-side, all the same lovely goldenrod color as the pad of stickies I keep by my bed for midnight idea-emergencies.
