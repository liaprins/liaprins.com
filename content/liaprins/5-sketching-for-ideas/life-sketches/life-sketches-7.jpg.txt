Caption: I love to explain how anything related to nature works, so I took the opportunity provided by the Inktober prompt “swift” to learn about chimney swifts and visually share the most interesting facts I discovered.

Alt: A sketch of a few chimney swifts: one in the center flying with wings extended—"the flying cigar a.k.a. chimney swift! This is the chimney swift's nickname due to its signature flying posture ... Their ratio of long wings to tiny body make them efficient flyers"; another is perched on a brick wall—"They really do perch inside chimney's walls"; and another on the ground trying to take off, with the speech bubble "Help!"—"swifts cannot take off from the ground!".
