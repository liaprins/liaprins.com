Caption: When I feel like drawing but can't figure out what to depict, I cover a page with a grid of boxes, then focus on filling each with a highlight from my day.

Alt: Eight panels, each with a red watercolor wash behind them, depicting the highlights of my day: coding, eating salad, reading, biking, sharpening several dozen colored pencils, boiling water for a pasta dinner, mailing letters to friends, and watercoloring this!
