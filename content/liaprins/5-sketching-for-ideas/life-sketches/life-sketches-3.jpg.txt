Caption: On an extended trip to Europe for work, I became so busy preparing presentations for our client that I got a bit out of my sketching habit. But a trip to the art museum of all art museums—the Louvre—inspired me to put my pen back to work, and helped me to transition back into using the medium as a design problem solving tool again.
