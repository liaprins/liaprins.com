Caption: It was a bit meta to be sketching <em>about</em> sketching when I outlined a talk I planned to give at World IA Day, but it helped to document visuals that referenced each of my more abstract concepts. Some of the sketches that had simply started as a shorthand to myself made their way into my final presentation as illustrations.
