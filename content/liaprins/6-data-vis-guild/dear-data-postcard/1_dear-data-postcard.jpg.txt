Caption: To demonstrate one interpretation of the "audio" prompt, I designed a network visualization that revealed the methods by which I’d discovered my favorite podcasts. Possible podcast origins include the radio, browsing my podcast app, and getting a suggestion from a friend. More likely, though, a podcast itself informed me of another podcast—in the form of a featured story or mention by the host—as indicated by the rings that spiral out from some nodes and connect to others.
