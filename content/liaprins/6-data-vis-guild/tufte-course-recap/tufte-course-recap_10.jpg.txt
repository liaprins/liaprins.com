Alt: Keep your standards of evidence high: there may be incentives to misrepresent data. For example, "scientific" (and other) papers sometimes intentionally mislead and skew results to get grants. Changing a datasetâ€™s scale from logarithmic to linear or vice versa can change the interpretation of results without actually changing the raw data per se.
