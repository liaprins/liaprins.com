title: Sketching for Ideas
thumb: sketching-for-ideas.jpg
intro: When the hanging file folder that stored my design sketches began to bend and buckle, it prompted me to wonder whether the sheer magnitude of my accumulated paper explorations, ink-imparted ideas, and long-dead designs might hold an opportunity for introspection into my personal approach to problem solving. <strong>I knew I turned to pen and paper over other tools when I wanted to iterate rapidly, but I wasn’t sure why this medium induced ideas in a way that others didn’t</strong> So when the over-burdened file folder finally burst, breaching my loose leaf sketches into the annoying abyss that is the bottom of a filing cabinet drawer, it (in combination with my compulsion to keep even annoying abysses organized) sparked my musings on the matter of sketching as a catalyst for ideas. As I picked apart my own pages and processes for patterns, <strong>I decided I’d exploit my findings to help others harness the power of pen and paper, too</strong>.
project-pretext: Personal
objective: Study my own process to learn, and ultimately share, how sketching serves as a superior medium for idea generation
Output channels: Workshop and presentations at Austin Design Week and World Information Architecture Day, onboarding course for new hires, Pecha Kucha, UX guild talk, multi-part Medium post (in-progress)

      <strong>Reflecting on my own process would allow me to become more self-aware of the practices I find helpful and those that I don’t</strong>; I'd be equipped with the knowledge needed to refine the way I work and would ultimately end up a more informed and efficient designer. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Others I worked with didn’t share ideas via sketches all that often, but <strong>if I could suss out what exactly made sketching such an effective medium for me, they might be inspired to reap its benefits</strong> as well.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>I wanted to practice public speaking and presenting to audiences of varying design backgrounds and levels of knowledge</strong>; this topic was one I could dig into and that held the potential to provide insights for those across the design-experience spectrum.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The channels through which and the audiences with whom I shared my learnings would each impose their own limitations, forcing me to reconsider how I told the story</strong> and what its main takeaways were. Testing my topic and insights this way would reveal what resonated and what didn't, compelling me to develop and push my concept further with each imparted iteration.

  <p>
    Based on the 4-inch-high stack of sketches I’d produced in as many years at work alone, I realized that the act of sketching served as a more suitable medium for conducting ideas than most other approaches and tools I’d tried. To learn why, I analyzed my lofty pile of potential evidence for clues.
  </p>

  <p>
    I examined the sketching techniques I’d adopted to convey my ideas, as well as shortcuts I’d developed as I became more relaxed and familiar with my materials over time. I’d found it helpful to start small when sketching screens and interfaces, because it physically forced me to leave inconsequential details by the wayside. Another pattern I took note of across my work again and again was the way I used color: I tended to abstractly encode meanings through hue in several different ways, rather than communicating the literal brand colors that the interfaces would ultimately end up taking.

    The launch of a new project or problem solving endeavor guaranteed that I'd reach for my mug of drawing utensils—once I'd even sketched over 70 pages within the first week of starting a new project—but in retrospect it became clear that wasn’t the only time.

  {% assign captions = 'One week I produced 72 pages of sketches exploring ways in which users could set thresholds for alerts on their analytics. 🟡 A user might only need to be alerted about their mobile app’s usage when a certain <em>combination</em> of metrics met given criteria.

  {% include gallery.html %}

  <p>
    I used sketches as a way to more thoroughly explore and understand a problem, but also drew upon them to communicate ideas to others. Paper prototypes worked well to that end, because they conveyed interactivity and allowed anyone with whom I shared them to test out my idea themselves, rather than just looking and listening. This helped my collaborators better understand my concepts, which in turn enabled them to provide better feedback and even grow my initial ideas further. 
  </p>

  {% include image.html image="paper-prototype.gif" alt="An animated .GIF that makes use of stop-motion to show the parts and pieces of my paper prototype moving in the ways a user would interact with it." caption="I built a quick paper prototype out of Post-its to explore a couple distinct mindsets to approaching the way an expanding panel within a UI interacted with the existing content: it could cover the content like a window shade—existing on a plane above, or it could live on the same level as the rest of the content and effectively push it down. I explored what these physical metaphors meant with tactile pieces of paper, making it easier for others to understand when I communicated these two options. It was helpful to explore both analogies in the context of the <em>types</em> of content the panel would apply to, as well—one was simply scrolling lists, while the other was a network diagram that could be panned and zoomed. To me, it didn't make sense for the panel to push down anything but scrollable content, but the window shade metaphor suited either content type equally well. The tangible prototype helped me to visualize my reasoning for this as well." %}

  <p>
    It was a sure sign that I’d return to my notebook with pen in hand if a design direction or a detail within it felt precariously presumptive: consciously—and often subconsciously—I knew that the problem space and its possible solutions needed to be scrutinized more thoroughly. My stack of sketches contained a considerable tally of sticky notes that had once made their home as part of a Post-it pad that still resides in my nightstand; I can fuzzily remember awakening in the night a number of times to hastily jot down an idea for a design problem that wouldn’t leave me alone, even in my dreams!
  </p>

For the same reason I always bring a few sticky notes and a pencil with me on my lunchtime walks." %}

  <p>
    I found that as my familiarity with sketching design ideas grew, so did my comfort with drawing for the sheer fun of it. Outside of the formal design process I've come to rely on sketching as a mechanism through which to examine the world around me in detail, communicate concepts to others visually, and investigate questions.

    Once I'd analyzed my stockpile of sketches (and safely filed them away, distributing their collective weight across multiple sturdy hanging folders), I decided to start a sketching club at work: it held the promise to help me learn more about others’ drawing habits while also allowing me to share a bit about what I’d picked up myself during my time as a diligent design-sketcher. The club started out strong but after a while began to fizzle out; it was hard to arrange times to meet that accommodated everyone. A teammate suggested we start with our immediate team at a regularly occurring time each week, making it something our smaller group could commit to and pull into our culture. Since then, passers by from other product teams have joined our sketching routine.
  </p>

  {% include image.html image="drawing-club.jpg" alt="Five of my fellow colleagues are heads-down sketching during a drawing club meet-up at work." %}

  <p>
    As I became consciously aware of the contexts in which I turned to sketching and the ways in which I manipulated the medium to help me, I began to plan ways to more deliberately share my insights. My first move was to condense my main points into a 20-slide, 6-and-a-half-minute Pecha Kucha that I presented to incoming designers at IBM.
  </p>

  {% include image.html image="pecha-kucha.jpg" alt="All 20 slides from my Pecha Kucha, formatted as a grid." caption="In a Pecha Kucha, each slide stays on the screen for exactly 20 seconds. I tried to use the fleeting time wisely, starting with an introduction to the concept of divergent design and idea generation, then transitioning into how the medium of sketching acts as an aid to this part of the process, and ending with tips to help onlookers start sketching more themselves." %}

  <p>
    Every time I presented my thoughts and approaches around the relationship between sketching and idea generation, I re-examined the way I told the story for my various viewers. And each time I finished sharing, I learned a little more from the questions my audience made me consider, and the connections they drew between my concepts and tangential topics. The time had arrived to build my insights into a more robust presentation that I could share beyond the walls of my workplace.
  </p>

  {% include image.html image="sketching-about-sketching.jpg" alt="A notebook spread displaying a rough attempt at storyboarding my talk about ideas and sketching, including preliminary illustrations for each slide." caption="It was a bit meta to be sketching <em>about</em> sketching when I outlined a talk I planned to give at World IA Day, but it helped to document visuals that referenced each of my more abstract concepts. Some of the sketches that had simply started as a shorthand to myself made their way into my final presentation as illustrations." %}

  <p>
    From there it was just a matter of identifying opportunities to distribute the insights and advice I’d collected through my sketching practice and that I’d been pushed to discover as I developed my talk and experimented with it around the studio.

  <p>
    After introspecting my stack of sketches and testing the resulting takeaways with others, I’d come to some conclusions around sketching as it fits into the larger practice of design. I'd also thought a lot about the ultimate output of sketching—divergent ideas—and their contribution to a solution.

  {% assign captions = 'These slides highlight a few of the main points from my talk covering the connection between ideas and sketching. 🟡  🟡 Good* ideas—according to my newly proposed definition—are ideally just one of many others, and don’t assume that their way is the only way. 🟡 They’re also capable of change, and are not stubbornly set in stone. 🟡 Good* ideas fearlessly spawn more ideas, even though it may mean that their “children” ideas outlive them when it comes time to converge on a final solution. 🟡 A truly good* idea knows when it’s time to let other ideas shine. They may be resurrected for a future problem, but they may not. 🟡 Good* ideas work together selflessly to create even better ideas. 🟡 Divergent design comes by the practice of developing this type of good* idea over and over—and allowing them to fizzle out, adapt to change, grow, and combine as needed. 🟡 Ultimately, the more ideas one starts with, the more likely they’ll uncover a solution that accounts for all aspects of the problem. 🟡 Even if you think you know exactly how to solve a problem, more likely than not, you’ll start to realize many more nuances as you begin to test your initial solution out. The more ideas your throw against the problem, the more you’ll learn about it. 🟡 Following one path single-mindedly from the get-go means you’re investing all your time and effort in that direction rather than exploring other options, but it also means that your mind is closed to finding serendipitous connections between the problem at hand and the world around you. 🟡 This specific notion has been studied by the Stanford Graduate School of Education. They assigned two groups a design problem, then gave the first a single idea as a sort of spark to get their minds turning, and gave the second three distinct ideas to consider. 🟡 Neither team was limited to using the idea(s) the facilitators had given them. Both iterated on their way to a final solution, but the first group barely strayed from the concept that had been planted in their minds. The group that had begun with three ideas from the start, however, developed even more ideas on their way to a significantly stronger ultimate solution, as determined by the study’s criteria.  🟡 The study concluded that simply starting with a couple of extra ideas meant that a would-be problem solver’s mind remained more open to other ideas and inspiration. 🟡  🟡 I clarified that, at least within the context of my talk, sketching was not simply a synonym for drawing, wherein the ultimate focus is on the output of an artifact. 🟡 Instead, the outcome of a sketching session should be <em>ideas</em>. The act of sketching should simply be a way to transport ideas from one’s mind out into the real world, and the artifact—the sketches—should be used to communicate one’s ideas to others. 🟡 This is the primary reason I’m drawn to sketching over more inhibiting methods like digital tools. 🟡 The quicker you can make something, the less time you waste on a direction that might not make the final cut, <em>and</em> the less likely you’ll invest in that idea prematurely. 🟡 Starting with a blank slate keeps you from taking any previous designs for granted; everything you include is there for a reason. 🟡 On the flip-side of the coin, the inherently messy nature of sketching can keep you from being tempted to perfect details that might not even make the next cut: you can’t kern your own handwriting, after all! 🟡 An idea presented as a sketch is easy to provide input on: the format focuses feedback around the <em>concept</em> rather than the details. Furthermore, the fact that sketches aren’t huge investments helps others to feel more open to suggest ways in which the idea could change or grow. 🟡 I ended by providing tangible methods to help my listeners pull sketching into their own process. 🟡 This slide serves as a not-so-subtle ode to my most beloved drawing utensil, the Pentel Rolling Writer, available in four classic shades, and ever-accessible at just 17 cents each! 🟡 Divergent thinking prioritizes quantity far above the tenet of quality hailed by the later convergent design phase. 🟡 For those new to the idea of sketching or out of the habit, jumping straight into it as part of the design process may be intimidating and might yield unproductive results. But I do believe it’s worthwhile to get comfortable with pen and paper. Drawing out any ideas, outside one’s design process—even an idiosyncratic invention—can help to build the association between sketching and idea creation.' | split: " 🟡 " %}

  <p>
    Of the many possible paths to a solid design outcome, nearly none are straight, short, or flat. Instead—comprised of vigorously winding routes that trail-blaze through previously unexplored territory—these trajectories to a final resolution are fraught with forks that veer out of sight and postulations that fizzle out. But if we are well-practiced in the creation of oodles of ideas, the very fact that we take an unpredictable path at all should be by design, as only through exploring the true extent of the problem space can we hope to arrive at a satisfactory and thoroughly considered design solution.

    Sketching makes for a superb idea-eliciting medium in part due to the unfinished feel of its outputs; compared to digitally rendered wireframes, sketches of interfaces and even interactions seem to reserve room for growth and change, which prevents both the sketcher and those they share their work with from getting too attached to a single direction too early on.

    I wanted to tangibly coax others into adopting the practice of sketching—or at least give them a great first impression of its potential—so I developed sketching exercises, and following my talk, led a workshop aiming to help others get comfortable with sketching, wield it as a force for divergent thinking, and put it to use communicating their concepts to others. You can even (file: liaprins_sketchingexercises.pdf text: have a look at the exercises target: blank) to try them out yourself.

    The unrefined messiness of a sketch is one of its biggest boons, and I believe that this quality should be embraced. However, when first attempting to apply sketching to their process, some expect their drawings to be beautiful, perfect renditions of the idea living in their mind. In my talk and workshop I aimed to help attendees get past the superficial layer of their sketches' visual styles, and instead to use lines, shapes, and shading to convey their ideas in a number of ways that can consumed by others.
